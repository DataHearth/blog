This post marks the beginning of [IoRw.dev](https://iorw.dev)!

## What is IoRw.dev?

[IoRw.dev](https://iorw.dev) is a plain, old-fashioned blog centered around technologies (both old and new) and their uses. In the spirit of open source, everything here is — and always will be — free to read and can be republished elsewhere, as long as the source is credited.

## Who am I?

I’m [DataHearth](https://github.com/DataHearth), a software engineer with a long-standing passion for IT. I particularly love development and the open-source mindset. It allows me to build whatever I want (relatively) easily and without restriction!

I'll be sharing stories, tutorials, guides, and more with you on this very platform — all about my passion and the things I discover every day.
